This is my first milestone project. I have choosen to create a Blackjack game. 

Object of the game:
Each  player has to attempt to beat the dealer or other player by getting a count as close to 21, without going over 21.

Card Values/Scoring:
Ace = 1 or 11 (up to player)
K, Q, or J = 10
All others are their pip value

<!-- I will add more instruction as I go and build the code. -->
- Hit: Deals your cards
- Stand: Deals the dealer's cards
- Deal: Resets the game
- Reset Score: Resets the table score
